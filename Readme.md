# OCR Data Mining
Throw an SVC classifier at a collection of student written characters.

Just to see if my own written characters can be identified.

The SVC was tested with the "linear", "poly", "rbf", and "sigmoid" kernels.

This was a midterm project.

Note: The test set (unseen data) was 10% of the data set. This may be adjusted in the function split_data().
